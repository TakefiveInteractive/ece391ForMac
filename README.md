# ECE391 Auto Setup For Mac Users

**NOTE**: Due to the update of swift, new cowhacker may not work on your machine (with Xcode 6). Check the release to find the compatible one.

**NOTE**: This setup will help you install Qemu 1.5, which is an old & buggy version. However Qemu 1.5 is officially used by ECE391, so you may want to not update it and use this Qemu instead of Qemu from brew. To overwrite all Qemu 1.5 setting for your Final Extra, do `brew install qemu` & `brew link --overwrite qemu`

~~We are going to rewrite this proj by **Go** for better compatibility.~~

or search ```tk5_uiuc``` on your [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) App.

This is a repo created for ece391, since officially there is no setup guide provided for OS X. 

Fully tested on OS X 10.10 :) 

For OS X 10.11 User, please ```make``` under ```cowhacker``` and then move ```cowhacker/bin/macosx/*/cowhacker{the one you just compiled}``` under ```cowhacker/```
## Usage

```fish
cd ~
git clone "https://github.com/TakefiveInteractive/ece391ForMac.git"
```
then run 

```fish
cd ece391ForMac
./start
```

then you can use the command ```ece391.dev``` to start the dev machine


if you prefer to use your default terminal or iTerm, you can then use
```ece391.ssh```after your dev machine successfully boot.


It you've down with your setting or MP, you can then run

```
./sync
```

**NOTE**: This functionality is deprecated. Though it works, it takes really really long. Make sure you're using campus network. In most cases you will not need it, but if you messed up your lab machine, and don't want to redo MP0~, try this.



under ~/ece391ForMac dir

You can use ```./mount391``` and ```./unmount391``` for shortcuts for mounting Shared Volumes :)

## Tux Controller

We would recommend doing this particular MP in the lab, but we do have a solution to connect Tux to Mac.

Open up the first terminal and launch:

```fish
socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/ece391socket,fork /dev/tty.usbserial-ECE391,raw,echo=0,ispeed=9600,ospeed=9600,clocal=1,cs8,nonblock=1,ixoff=0,ixon=0,crtscts=0
```
Open up the second terminal, launch qemu with this extra parameter:

```
-serial unix:/tmp/ece391socket
```
