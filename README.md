# ECE391 Auto Setup For Mac


This is a repo created for ece391, since officially there is no setup guide provided for OS X. 

## Usage

```fish
cd ~
git clone "https://github.com/Tedko/ece391ForMac.git"
```
then run 

```fish
cd ece391ForMac
./start
```
```./start``` will automatically download all files and sources need for ece391, and will unzip them;
then it will trigger ```./setup_mac``` for installing ```Qemu 1.5``` and create three links on your desktop.
