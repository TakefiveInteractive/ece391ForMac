# ECE391 Auto Setup For Mac Users


This is a repo created for ece391, since officially there is no setup guide provided for OS X. 

Fully tested on OS X 10.10 :)
## Usage

```fish
cd ~
git clone "https://github.com/Tedko/ece391ForMac.git"
```
then run 

```fish
cd ece391ForMac
./start
```

then you can use the command ```ece391.dev``` to start the dev machine


if you prefer to use your default terminal or iTerm, you can then use
```ece391.ssh```after your dev machine successfully boot.


It you've down with your setting or MP, you can then run 

```./sync```under ~/ece391ForMac dir
